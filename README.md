Compilation via Makefile,including re, clean and fclean rules.

Double linked list integer sorting algorithm.

The game is made up of two linked lists of numbers named l_a and l_b.
In the beginning, l_b will be empty and l_a will contain a certain amount of positive or negative numbers.
The objective of the game is to sort l_a with the minimum number of different operations, while being time-optime.

It prints each operation it does.
